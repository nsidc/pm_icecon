USEAGE:
*******
	To compile use 'make_interpol' at the command line.
	To run the program use 'interpol'.
	
DESCRIPTION:
************
	'interpol' linearly interpolates missing pixels in a sequence of
images. THE FIRST and THE LAST image must be completely filled. User specifies
the dates of the first and last image and increment for the date. Currently
nearest neighbor interpolation is not operational and hence 'INTERPOLATION
RANGE' has no meaning. Specify the file parameters ( dimension, type, missing
value ). Buffer size is the number of images it keeps in memory at a time.
Specify higher buffer size depending on the memory. Input and output
directories actually specify the input / output filename formats. The program
recognizes keywords such as year, month etc., which are described below. Each
keyword must be enclosed in a pair of #.

Keywords and their descriptions:
	year	=> year of the century ( 95 for 1995 )
	month	=> month of the year ( 01-12 )
	monthname	=> name of the month ( jan-dec )
	day	=> day of the month ( 01-31 )
	jday	=> day of the year ( 01-366 )
	century => century ( 19 for 1995 )

For example, s#century##year##jday#.19v would be replaced by s1995001.19v for a
files corresponding to day 1 for 1995. The set of keywords can be expanded by
altering 'name_convention' procedure in 'string.pro'.

Calendar interface:
	Select the desired month, year and click on the day buttons to select.
Click on 'Quit' to cancel. The cursor movement on the day buttons displays the
'day of the year'.

Counter interface ( obtained when 'step' button is clicked ):
	'No' is the value returned in 'Ok' is selected. 'No' is incremented /
decremented using the arrow buttons. The increment / decrement value is
determined by the 'Step' value.

Once the selections are made click 'Run' to interpolate, 'Quit' to exit.
'Interrupt' button interrupts the process.

Linear interpolation requires that the first and the last frame of the data
must be completely filled. It uses a buffer to store the data, a fill matrix
to store the values and a corresponding time matrix to store the index of source
frame.

NOTES:
******
	All the files must be in the same directory. This can be avoided if
'name_convention' is made to accept conditional keywords. If 'interpol' is
moved to a new directory change the 'location' environment variable in 
'interpol' script to the full pathname of the new directory.
